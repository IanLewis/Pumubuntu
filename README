Use run.sh to start the program. It will add a flag to the indicators:

Blue flag: Pomodoro is freezed
Red flag: Pomodoro in progress
Yellow flag: Break time
Green flag: Pause time! :D Time to get a coffee and relax

Click on the flag to display the options:
* Click on the timer to start/stop a Pomodoro cycle. Remember, if you stop a Pomodoro it will start from 0! If a Pomodoro Begins, It Has to Ring!!!
* Click on preferences if you want to change Pomodoros/breaks/pauses length.


RUNNING AT STARTUP:
To add the applet to your bar on each log in, open Startup Applications (Ubuntu) and add a new item like this:
Name: Pumubuntu
Command: padsp /home/<user>/<PumubuntuDir>/pomodoro.py
Comment: Pomodoro Timer

It's important to add the full path, the program won't start if you use a shortcut.
ie.: Using a shortcut like "~/Pumubuntu/pomodoro.py" is NOT valid and the applet won't start. So, if you have problems to start the app, you should start by checking that you added the full path.

Note: "padsp" is not needed in older Ubuntu versions. But it is needed if you are using Ubuntu 11.04
